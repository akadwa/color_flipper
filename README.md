## Color Flipper
In this project I have created a 'Color Flipper' using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Click [here](https://akadwa.github.io/color_flipper/) to view the live page.

There are two webpages:
1. The 'Simple' page
This page serves as the homepage. When the button is clicked the background color of the document will change to a randomly selected color from a set array of colors.

2. The 'Hex' page
When the button is clicked the background color of the document will change to a randomly generated color from an array of letters and numbers.

**Please note that this project was originally created in the *personal_practice_projects/Javascript/1_color_flipper/* folder but was moved into this new repo so as to allow it to be live viewed**
